Please review the following code for performance issues and potential optimizations:

```
def slow_function():
    result = []
    for i in range(1000):
        result.append(i * 2)
    return result
```

Provide a detailed analysis including:
1. Performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies
2. Memory usage concerns
3. Algorithm complexity issues
4. Suggestions for optimization
5. Best practices recommendations

Please provide the review as text output.
